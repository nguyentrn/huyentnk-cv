      "content": "### My Thought Process\n\n**1. Starting with a Question**\n\nHow can a historical tour become more appealing to a younger, tech-savvy audience, alongside its traditional customer base? Instead of just thinking about advertising, I started with the tourist's experience itself. I realized what was missing was interaction, a multi-sensory journey. From there, the idea of integrating Virtual Reality (VR) into the tour was born, allowing visitors to 'relive' historical moments at the sites, adding a new emotional depth to their journey.\n\n**2. From Idea to Story**\n\nWith VR as the centerpiece, I began to craft a central narrative for the entire campaign: 'Relive History - Experience the Journey'. This was a promise of an emotional experience, not just a simple sightseeing trip.\n\n**3. Bringing the Story to Life Through Design**\n\nTo spread the story, I designed a cohesive set of print materials, each with a specific purpose. Since this tour goes to the majestic mountainous region of Cao Bang, I built a consistent visual identity for the campaign. I used shades of forest green and river turquoise as the main colors, combined with golden orange to highlight key messages (price, promotions). The imagery always combined magnificent landscapes with a technological element (the VR headset experience), emphasizing the unique aspect of this tour.\n\n**Phase 1: Sparking Curiosity (Print)**\n\n<img src=\"/images/mardv/Flyer.png\" alt=\"Flyer introducing the VR experience tour.\">\n\n**Layout:** Used a stunning image of Ban Gioc Waterfall as the hero image to convey the majestic beauty of nature. Four smaller images were integrated to showcase the diverse destinations in the tour (Ba Be Lake, Nguom Ngao Cave, Pac Bo historical site).\n\n- Human and Technology Element: The image of a man wearing a VR headset is prominently placed, not only creating curiosity but also directly explaining the tagline 'Relive History - Experience the Journey'. This is the product's USP.\n\n- Headline: 'Cao Bang - Pac Bo - Ban Gioc Waterfall' was designed with a soft, flowing font, evoking a sense of adventure and discovery.\n\n- Call-to-Action (CTA): The 'BOOK NOW' button and hotline number 1900 1808 were placed in a highly visible location to drive customer action.\n\n<img src=\"/images/mardv/Brochure-1.png\" alt=\"Front of the brochure when opened, detailing the itinerary.\">\n\n**Layout:** Utilized the tri-fold structure of the brochure to logically segment information:\n\n- Cover Page: The tour's main image 'Ban Gioc Waterfall' and the main tagline to make a strong first impression and entice people to open it, a QR code leading to the detailed information page, and the brand logo.\n\n- Introduction Page: Sharp images of the destinations and an emphasis on the VR experience within the tour.\n\n- Information Page: Detailed 'TOUR INCLUDES' section (sightseeing, hotel, transport) using intuitive, easy-to-understand icons. Clear contact information (Website, Email, Phone, Facebook).\n\n<img src=\"/images/mardv/Brochure-2.png\" alt=\"Back of the brochure when opened, with tour packages and promotional information.\">\n\n- Focus on 'SALE' for a special occasion: Designed to be large, bold, and distinct to immediately grab attention. The 'Valid until' information was placed right next to the discounted price to urge customers to make a quick decision. The price figures were highlighted with contrasting colors (yellow, red) to increase visibility.\n\n- Tiered Offers: The 'Family Package' and 'Premium Package' were clearly separated, each with its own price and included services (represented by intuitive icons) to make it easy for customers to compare and choose.\n\n**Phase 2: Creating a Highlight (Event)**\n\n<img src=\"/images/mardv/Event-flyer.png\" alt=\"Flyer specifically for the VR experience launch event.\">\n\nThis was to announce and invite people to a free VR experience event, creating media buzz and collecting leads from potential customers.\n\n- Main Focus: The word 'VR' was stylized, integrated with nature imagery, and became the centerpiece of the design, instantly communicating the event's theme. Alongside it, an image of someone experiencing VR further emphasized the event's content.\n\n- Clear Information: The most important details (Time - Date - Location) were presented in separate, easy-to-read colored blocks. The word 'FREE' was bolded to increase appeal.\n\nBesides contact info, a QR code for 'Register Now' made it easy to collect information and measure effectiveness.\n\n**Phase 3: Increasing Awareness (OOH)**\n\n<img src=\"/images/mardv/Billboard.png\" alt=\"Out-of-home (Billboard) design for the Saigontourist tour.\">\n\nDesign Concept:\n- A magnificent image of Ban Gioc Waterfall as the background immediately catches the eye and evokes feelings of nature travel.\n- The line 'Experience historical landmarks with VR technology' in a prominent green color and large font instantly conveys the product's unique selling point.\n- The '10%' discount and '4,050,000 VND' price in high-contrast orange, along with the validity period, highlight the economic benefit and create a sense of urgency. The Saigontourist logo in the left corner reinforces brand identity.\n\nOverall Layout:\n- Instead of static blocks of information, I used a dynamic, asymmetrical layout with tilted 'polaroid' frames to create a sense of movement, adventure, and collected memories. The image of the man with the VR headset appears to be 'interacting' with the photos, strongly reinforcing the tech-enhanced experience concept.\n\nPeople waiting for the bus have enough time to see the details: small photos of tour destinations, detailed contact information, and especially the 'More Info' QR code to scan and learn more on their phones.",

Therefore, the phrase 'HOT DEALS & GIFTS' and the '50% Off Entire Live' banner were designed with a large size and placed in the most central, visible position, emphasizing the biggest benefit for the customer.\n\n**Other Offers:** The smaller coupons at the bottom (Minigame Coupon, Gift Combo, 1K Deal) serve as secondary reasons to convince viewers that this is a high-value livestream they can't afford to miss.",

      "content": "### The Core Idea\n\nTết (Lunar New Year) is a time when people return to their roots to honor the quintessence that shapes our national identity. Instead of just talking about Tết, we should act for Tết and for the core cultural values of the Vietnamese people. I thought, why not combine Bia Saigon Lager's product with cultural stories? This would turn an everyday consumer product into a powerful communication medium, a bridge connecting modern consumers with traditional values that are gradually being forgotten.\n\nThe \"Seven Brews of Saigon\" collection, a special limited edition for the Year of the Horse in 2026, transforms each can into a tribute to Vietnam's traditional craft villages, many of which are slowly fading. Bia Saigon Lager will partner with the Thai My weaving village to create handwoven gift baskets for Tết, helping to generate more sales and introduce the village's craft to a wider audience.\n\nThe message, \"Raise a Lager, Fuel the Legacy of Craft Villages,\" is not just a tagline but a call to action. \"Raising a glass\" during gatherings is a familiar act of enjoying beer, but now it takes on a new meaning—the act of \"fueling the legacy,\" supporting and spreading the value of these craft villages.\n\nThe goal of this IMC campaign is to increase consumer affinity for Bia Saigon Lager, positioning the brand not only as a beer for enjoyment but also as one with a mission to preserve and promote cultural values. The campaign will include activities to support the livelihoods of craft artisans, giving them opportunities to access a larger market and thrive in the modern era.\n\n### Thought and Design Process\n\n**Research, Selection, and Story Crafting**\n\nI began by researching Vietnam's traditional craft villages, especially those facing challenges. I selected seven representative villages, each with its own unique character (pottery, forging, weaving, bamboo blinds, etc.).\nFor each village, I crafted a short but emotional story, highlighting both its beauty and its struggles.\n\n**Crafting Unique Blessings Inspired by Each Traditional Craft**\n\nTo make each can a meaningful gift for Tết, I composed rhyming couplets of blessings that relate to the craft's characteristics while also conveying wishes for luck and prosperity in the new year.\n\n**The Packaging Design Process**\n\nThe packaging is the product's most direct and powerful communication channel. I learned to turn it into a storytelling tool that conveys a mission and creates differentiation.\n\nThe primary rule was to maintain Bia Saigon Lager's core brand identity elements (logo, golden dragon symbol, diagonal ribbon). I only modified one side of the can, ensuring consumers could still recognize their familiar brand.\n\nI used traditional motifs and colors characteristic of each craft. All 7 cans follow a consistent layout, with the collection's name \"The Seven Brews of Saigon,\" \"Tết Bính Ngọ,\" and \"Limited Edition\" text affirming the product's special, campaign-exclusive value.\n\n1.  **Cham Pottery:** \"Golden fortune blooms from the earth – A prosperous spring arrives\"\n<img src=\"/images/imc/1.png\" alt=\"Saigon Lager Can - Cham Pottery Craft\">\n\n2.  **Hmong Forging:** \"Forged in fire, steel-like will – Reaching far with steady skill\"\n<img src=\"/images/imc/2.png\" alt=\"Saigon Lager Can - Hmong Forging Craft\">\n\n3.  **Thai Brocade Weaving:** \"Weaving golden threads of fate – Perfect luck at your gate\"\n<img src=\"/images/imc/3.png\" alt=\"Saigon Lager Can - Thai Brocade Weaving\">\n\n4.  **Do Xa Bamboo Blinds:** \"Hang up blessings, welcome fortune's grace – A peaceful spring fills this place\"\n<img src=\"/images/imc/4.png\" alt=\"Saigon Lager Can - Do Xa Bamboo Blind Craft\">\n\n5.  **Tuong Binh Hiep Lacquerware:** \"Painting prosperity in every art – A future shining from the start\"\n<img src=\"/images/imc/5.png\" alt=\"Saigon Lager Can - Tuong Binh Hiep Lacquerware\">\n\n6.  **Tay Weaving:** \"Weaving fortunes tight and true – Braiding bonds of love for you\"\n<img src=\"/images/imc/6.png\" alt=\"Saigon Lager Can - Tay Weaving Craft\">\n\n7.  **Nghi Phong Dó Paper:** \"Paper holds the marks of jade – A spring of perfect blessings made\"\n<img src=\"/images/imc/7.png\" alt=\"Saigon Lager Can - Nghi Phong Dó Paper Craft\">",

To get the shots to 'click', the whole team had to coordinate and support each other extensively.\n\n- **Post-production and Editing:** I took on the post-production, using editing techniques in Capcut to highlight the product and convey the brand's energy.\n\n**3.
